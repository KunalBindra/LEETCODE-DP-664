# LEETCODE-DP-664
To analyze the code, let's break it down into its components and perform a dry run on a specific example.

**Class Structure:**

- `Solution` class: This class contains the logic for solving the strange printer problem.
- `dp` array: A 2D array used for memoization, storing previously calculated results.
- `strangePrinter` method: Initializes the `dp` array and calls the `turn` method to calculate the minimum number of passes required to print the string.
- `turn` method:
  - Takes the string `s`, starting index `i`, and ending index `j` as input.
  - Base cases:
    - If `i` is greater than `j`, it means the substring is empty, and the minimum number of passes is 0.
    - If the result is already cached in `dp[i][j]`, it returns the cached value.
  - Recursive case:
    - Sets the default value for `dp[i][j]` as `turn(s, i, j - 1) + 1`, indicating at least one pass is required to print the last character.
    - Iterates from `i` to `j - 1`:
      - If the current character (`s.charAt(j - 1)`) is the same as the character at index `k - 1`, it checks if printing the substring from `i` to `k` and the substring from `k + 1` to `j - 1` recursively and adding the results is less than the current minimum.
    - Returns the minimum value stored in `dp[i][j]`.

**Example:**

Let's consider the string "abcabc".

1. **Initial call:** `strangePrinter("abcabc")` calls `turn(s, 1, 6)`.
2. **`turn(s, 1, 6)`:**
   - Base cases don't apply.
   - `dp[1][6]` is initialized to `turn(s, 1, 5) + 1`.
   - Iterating `k`:
     - `k = 1`: No match.
     - `k = 2`: No match.
     - `k = 3`: Match found.
       - `dp[1][6] = min(turn(s, 1, 3) + turn(s, 4, 5), dp[1][6])`.
       - `turn(s, 1, 3)` and `turn(s, 4, 5)` will be calculated recursively.

**Recursive calls and memoization:**

The `turn` method will continue to be called recursively, breaking down the string into smaller substrings until it reaches the base cases. Memoization ensures that results for previously calculated substrings are cached, avoiding redundant calculations.

**Overall:**

The code efficiently calculates the minimum number of passes required to print a given string using a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. It effectively handles cases where substrings can be printed in fewer passes by identifying matching characters and combining the results.
